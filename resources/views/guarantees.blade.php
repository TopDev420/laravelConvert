                    <h3 class="primary-title">95% DELIVERABILITY GUARANTEE</h3>
                    <p>All of our email lists come with a 95% deliverability guarantee.* Why not 100%? The reason for
                        this is
                        that in the world today, people are constantly changing jobs and/or positions, and companies
                        may move and change their telephone numbers, names, websites, or email addresses. In order to
                        keep up with a world that changes rapidly, we update our database daily using thousands of
                        sources, but because contact info can change so much and so quickly, it is impossible to reach
                        100% deliverability in this industry. Our aim is to provide you the most up-to-date data. Right
                        now,
                        there isn’t a single company in the world that will deliver such qualified data with lower
                        prices than Bookyourdata.com — we are perfectly sure about that!</p>

                    <h3 class="primary-title">Bounce-Back Guarantee</h3>
                    <p>We know it is bad when a customer thinks the service they received wasn’t worthy of its price.
                        To prevent such situations, we promise a 95% deliverability rate with our data. If a customer
                        runs
                        across an deliverability level lower than 95%, simply send us the report showing the hard-bounce
                        rate of the email list purchased and we will provide free data credits until our 95%
                        deliverability
                        promise is satisfied. For example, if the hard-bounce rate appears to be 20%, meaning the
                        deliverability level is 80%, we will provide free credits for 15% more data. Thus, you’ll always
                        get what you paid for.</p>
