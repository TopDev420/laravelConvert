                        General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), is the main legislation in
                        Europe that seriously affects the whole personal data processing
                        activities. Whilst, bringing drastic changes for the companies like;
                        monetary fines up to % 4 of the global turnover or 20 Million Euros, it is
                        extending the rights of the data subjects as well; like “right to be
                        forgotten” claims. In such dynamic realm where privacy will be “by design”
                        the core principle shall be providing more control to the owners over their
                        personal data.

                        As explicit consent is the primary pre-requisite for data processing, <strong><u>“legitimate
                                interest”</u></strong> is one of exceptions of it and is
                        the most flexible lawful basis for processing.

                        So, what is legitimate interest?

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p>
                        An ‘interest’ can be considered as ‘legitimate’, as long as the Controller
                        can pursue this interest in a way that complies with data protection and
                        other laws.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Legitimate interest has been defined both in Article 6 1(f) of GDPR and its
                        Recital 47. Especially the marketing purposes are avidly defined as
                        legitimate in Recital 47 as follows;
                        <em>
                            “…The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be
                            regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest.”
                        </em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, this does not automatically mean that all processing for marketing
                        purposes is lawful on this basis. You still need to show that your
                        processing passes the necessity and balancing tests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When looking at the balancing test, you should also consider factors such
                        as:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            whether people would expect you to use their details in this way;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the potential nuisance factor of unwanted marketing messages; and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the effect your chosen method and frequency of communication might have
                            on more vulnerable individuals; like children.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Given that individuals have the absolute right to object to direct
                        marketing under Article 21(2), it is more difficult to pass the balancing
                        test if you do not give individuals <strong><u>a clear option to opt out of direct
                                marketing</u></strong> when you
                        initially collect their details (or in your first communication, if the
                        data was not collected directly from the individual).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The legitimate interests can be your own interests or the interests of
                        third parties. They can include commercial interests, individual interests
                        or broader societal benefits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You must balance your interests against the individual’s. If they would not
                        reasonably expect the processing, or if it would cause unjustified harm,
                        their interests are likely to override your legitimate interests.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>“Yes” indeed</strong>
                        . This type of processing will be lawful as well, on the basis of
                        legitimate interests, but you need to apply the <strong><u>3-part Legitimate Interest Assessment
                                test.</u></strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can consider using legitimate interests as your lawful basis for such
                        processing. However, you need to identify your specific interest underlying
                        the processing and ensure that the processing is actually necessary for
                        that purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Assuming you can meet these first two parts of the three-part test, you
                        also need to consider the balancing test. You may find it is
                        straightforward as business contacts are more likely to reasonably expect
                        the processing of their personal data in a business context, and the
                        processing is less likely to have a significant impact on them personally.

                        According to the ICO, DMA and related regulatory bodies’ guidelines, <strong>you SHOULD perform
                            a legitimate interests assessment test</strong>
                        to help you demonstrate compliance if required.

                        There are 3 elements to the legitimate interests basis. It helps to think
                        of this as a 3-part test, which will be the main pillar of your LIA. In
                        this test you need to:

                                identify a legitimate interest;

                            <li>
                                show that the processing is necessary to achieve it; and
