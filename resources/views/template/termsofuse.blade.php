                            contract for a set term in which the user will be charged the current subscription rate and their
                            account will be credited with the corresponding number of credits. If a User selects a subscription
                            option, User enters into a binding purchase contract for the corresponding period of time by processing
                            their order. Subsequent payments will automatically be billed to User’s provided method of payment on
                            the anniversary of the subscription (e.g. each month for a monthly subscription or each year for an
                            annual subscription). Additionally, User has the option to save their credit card information to their
                            account to be used for any other purchases. All payments are processed by the Company’s third-party
                            payment processor and payment information will also be stored by the payment processor. User understands
                            and agrees that Company is not liable for the storage of information by the payment processor. The User
                            further affirms that the name, personal and financial information provided before the sale are true
                            and correct. The Company shall not be liable in the event that the Data is not usable as a
                            result of its failure to duly provide the necessary information.<br><br>
                            With regard to subscription packages, User will have the ability to enter into a contract
                            to obtain a set number of credits per month for a designated period of months.
                            For example, 10 credits per month for a period of 12 months for a total of 120 credits. User will
                            be charged a total fee for the subscription plan that will be divided into monthly payments
                            over the course of the subscription term. By enrolling in the subscription plan and
                            submitting payment information, User agrees that Company may automatically bill User for
                            the monthly subscription payment. Upon enrolling in the subscription plan, User enters into
                            a binding contract for the full term of the subscription plan and is responsible for full payment
                            of the total amount. If User fails to make the monthly payments, Company may take collections
                            actions, including legal action, against User. No refunds are available for subscription
                            plan purchases; however, credits do not expire.
